Title: Switching Scenes in JavaFX

Problem: Need to move between multiple screens (login, dashboard, settings) defined in different FXML files.

Key idea: Reuse the same Stage and either create a new Scene or change the root of the existing Scene when loading another FXML.

Steps:

Put all FXML files in the resources folder, for example:

LoginView.fxml

DashboardView.fxml

In the controller, load the target FXML with FXMLLoader.

Get the current Stage from any node in the event.

Set the new Scene (or new root) on that Stage.

Code example (create new Scene):
@FXML
private void handleLogin(ActionEvent event) throws IOException {
Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(
getClass().getResource("/com/example/app/DashboardView.fxml")
);
Stage stage = (Stage) ((Node) event.getSource())
.getScene().getWindow();
Scene scene = new Scene(root);
stage.setScene(scene);
stage.show();
}

Code example (reuse same Scene):
@FXML
private void goToSettings(ActionEvent event) throws IOException {
Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(
getClass().getResource("/com/example/app/SettingsView.fxml")
);
Scene scene = ((Node) event.getSource()).getScene();
scene.setRoot(root);
}

Common errors:

“Location is not set” or “Location is required”: the FXML path in getResource is wrong or the file is not under the resources folder.

NullPointerException on FXMLLoader.load: getResource returned null, usually due to a missing leading “/” or a typo in the path.
