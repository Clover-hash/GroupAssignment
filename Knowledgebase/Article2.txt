Why Was My Ride or Order Cancelled?

Answer:
Your ride or order may be cancelled for several reasons, including driver or delivery partner availability, unexpected delays, or safety concerns. In some cases, cancellations occur if the partner cannot reach your pickup or delivery location.

If your order was cancelled by the system or partner, any charges made will be automatically refunded to your original payment method or credited to your wallet. Refund processing times may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.

You can check the cancellation details in the order history section of the app.
