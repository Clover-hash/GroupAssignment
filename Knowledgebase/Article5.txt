How Do I Contact Customer Support?

Answer:
You can contact customer support directly through the app for the fastest assistance. Go to Help, select the relevant order or ride, and choose the issue you’re experiencing.

Most common questions can be resolved instantly through our in-app help system or automated responses. For more complex issues, your request will be reviewed by a support agent.

Phone and email support may be limited, so we recommend using in-app support whenever possible.
