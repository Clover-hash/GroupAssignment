I Was Charged the Wrong Amount. What Should I Do?

Answer:
Fare or price adjustments can happen due to route changes, waiting time, toll fees, or changes made during the trip or order. The final amount is calculated based on actual service usage.

If you believe the charge is incorrect, go to Help > Past Orders/Rides, select the affected transaction, and choose “Fare or payment issue.” Our support system will review the details and process any eligible refunds automatically.

You will be notified in the app once the review is complete.
